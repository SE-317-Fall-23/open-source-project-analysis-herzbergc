## I. Introduction
- For this assignment, I'll be writing my analysis of the usage of unit testing is Pytest. 

## II. Types of Testing in the Project
### A. Unit Testing
- In Pytest, the unit tests were written in order to ascertain wether or not features of pytest are working. 
- The functionality of Pytester is specifically targeted within the unit tests in Pytest. Pytest is directly responsible for the execution of Pytests. So, the tests check things like if it can generate Pytests, execute them, if it can path correctly, and if various other features and settings are working. 
- In the imports for the testing files, it seems like they are directly making their tests with pytest. I can't see anything like JUNIT being used, so I think they are testing using their own framework. Which isn't too far fetched considering its a software testing software.


## III. Reasons for Choosing These Testing Type
In the case of Pytest, there are many different methods belonging to different classes that need to be tested. Since these portions of code are small individually, it makes sense to use unit testing because we know exactly what sort of results each method should be producing in different situations. These methods aren't open ended, and thus are predictable in terms of output. With unit tests Pytest was able to easily create dozens of small tests that verify the functionality of its source code.
